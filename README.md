# brut-experiments-junod
In this repo I'd like to pull the code I'm using in order to torture a spare full node while making experiments with juno.

This is an 'art brut' coding example, and super-amateur. Apologies. I'm just another engineer in the O&amp;M branch.

## searching for missing differences in signing

[Check it out here](/missing-diff)

The main program shared here is missing\_diff.py, which is a brute force algorithm that allows me to use one spare full node in order to find and report any differences in the missing block count of each validator. I will just report in my webpage https://windpowerstake.github.io/ccf-juno.html the results I log.
